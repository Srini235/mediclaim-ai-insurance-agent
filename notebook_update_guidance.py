"""Notebook guidance for 105.ipynb updates.

This file contains the exact notebook text and code adjustments needed to
keep the notebook aligned with the current repo layout and root-based runtime
behavior.

# Replace any hardcoded repository-folder references with generic root-based
# execution guidance. For example, replace:
#
#   cd mediclaim-ai-insurance-agent
#
# with:
#
#   python train_and_save.py
#   python -m uvicorn src.api.server:app --reload --port 8000
#
# The codebase now resolves `src` from the repository root and does not depend
# on the folder name.
